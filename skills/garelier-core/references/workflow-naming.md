# Garelier workflow display-string naming (`ga-*`)

The strings a jig / Workflow run surfaces — in `/workflows`, in task
notifications, and on the Status Web — follow one convention so a single run
reads identically across `/workflows`, the dispatch board (`in_flight.md`),
`events.jsonl`, and the branch name. Four surfaces, four rules.

## 1. `meta.name` — `ga-<op>`

The workflow's operation: `ga-` prefix, lower-kebab. Fixed set:

- `ga-tick` — full dock-lane tick (Dispatch→Gate→Integrate→Record→Smith).
- `ga-gate` — gate + integrate + record for already-produced (held) branches.
- `ga-smith` — accumulated-window hardening.
- `ga-audit` — read-only inventory / scan (no merge).
- `ga-promote-check` — pre-promote verification.

Add a new `ga-<op>` only for a genuinely new operation.

Do NOT encode the run instance (task `#N`, timestamp) in the name. The harness
already stamps every run with a Run ID (`wf_…`) and a timestamp (shown in the
notification and on the Status Web). Also `meta` is a pure literal and the
script may not call `Date.now()` / `new Date()`, so a per-run timestamp cannot
be generated in-script — a reusable template would otherwise show the same
string on every run. The name says WHAT the workflow is; the harness says WHICH
run.

## 2. `meta.description` — `<Stage>…→…<Stage> <object> (DEC-NNN)`

One terse line. Stage words are the canonical phase titles; the gate's internal
order is written `Guardian→refute→Observer`. Use the arrow `→` (U+2192), never
ASCII `->`. End with the governing DEC.

> `Gate(Guardian→refute→Observer)→Integrate→Record for held #79 (DEC-062)`

## 3. `meta.phases[].title` — the Status-Web Pipeline stages

Title-case, from the fixed set: `Preflight` · `Dispatch` · `Gate` ·
`Integrate` · `Record` · `Smith`. These are the grouping keys of the Status Web
**Pipeline** view — do NOT invent new stage words. `detail` is one terse line.

## 4. agent `label` — `<step>:<slug>`

Lower-case, colon-separated.

- `<step>` from the fixed step vocabulary: `preflight` · `produce` · `advise`
  · `guardian` · `refute` · `observer` · `merge` · `record` · `smith` (a producer
  may instead use its role: `worker` / `scout` / …). `advise` is a producer's
  one-shot Observer direction-advice request mid-Dispatch (DEC-019, advisory).
- `<slug>` is the EXACT kebab task slug from `dispatch_prepare` — the same slug
  in the dispatch board `Task` column and in the branch `…/#<N>/<slug>`. A
  non-task step uses `<step>:<qualifier>` (`preflight:doctor+base`,
  `smith:window-check`).

Use `:` (not `-`): the slug itself contains `-`, so a `-` separator would blur
the step↔slug boundary (`guardian-p2-5b-…` is ambiguous; `guardian:p2-5b-…`
is not).

## Alignment guarantee

| surface | shared token |
| --- | --- |
| `/workflows` phase groups ↔ Status Web **Pipeline** | the stage set |
| `/workflows` label slug ↔ board **Task** ↔ **branch** `<slug>` | one kebab slug |
| label step / role ↔ Status Web role vocabulary | guardian / observer / smith / worker… |
| `events.jsonl` `kind` (unchanged) | start / complete / blocked / rework / cleanup / note |

Enforced elsewhere (not display strings): `<slug>` is kebab `[a-z0-9-]`
(`dispatch_prepare.sh`); the branch is
`garelier/<target-slug>/<pm_id>/<family>/#<N>/<slug>` (`worktree-addressing.md`).

## Worked examples

| run | `meta.name` | a few labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| full tick dispatching worker #80 | `ga-tick` | `produce:p2-5c-spatial-collision-fixed32`, `advise:p2-5c-spatial-collision-fixed32` (worker-requested), `guardian:p2-5c-spatial-collision-fixed32`, `merge:p2-5c-spatial-collision-fixed32` |
| gate held #79 | `ga-gate` | `guardian:p2-5b-replication-dimension-position-wire`, `refute:…`, `observer:…`, `merge:…`, `record:…` |
| smith window | `ga-smith` | `smith:window-check`, `smith:window-hardening`, `smith:guardian` |
